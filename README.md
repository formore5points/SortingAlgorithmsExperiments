# SortingAlgorithmsExperiments
For Algorithm Analysis Course, experiments on sorting algorithms in Java
Here is a report of the study on the analysis of the running times of the selected algorithms. Time based comparisons were made between algorithms. Calculations of the working time of the algorithms were performed on the 1000, 10000 and 100000 arrays. The resulting miliseconds differed in each algorithm. Based on these results, algorithms were listed. A table was created from the data obtained as a result of this ranking. The advantages and disadvantages of the algorithms were determined by the table.
 As a result of these comparisons, the fastest and slowest algorithms were decided. Finally, my thoughts on the given problem and my solution proposal were written.


Investigated Algorithms:
1) Heap Sort
2) Quick Sort
   -First Element Pivoting
   -Random Element Pivoting
   -Mid Of First-Mid-Last Element Pivoting
   -Dual Pivoting
3) Intro Sort


Under Conditions:
1) An Array of 1000 Size
2) An Array of 10000 Size
3) An Array of 100000 Size
